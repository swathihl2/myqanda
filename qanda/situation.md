## How do you handle stress? | How do you handle Work life balance?

    I will give my best of my knowledge to support my team and organization. 
    I am fully able to understand my bandwidth in earlier itself and which worst case I will make a callout about the status immediately without affecting process, 
    so I can assure my work life will balance always.


## What would you do if you were assigned a project with an unclear deadline?

    I would first seek clarification from my manager or the project stakeholders about the timeline. If that’s not possible,
    I’d create a rough timeline based on project milestones and communicate that with the team. 
    I’d also prioritize tasks and remain adaptable, ready to adjust as more information becomes available.


## How would you handle a situation where you disagree with a team member about the best approach to a project?

    I would approach the situation by having an open discussion with the team member. 
    I’d listen to their reasoning and present my perspective with data to support my ideas. If we still disagree, 
    I’d suggest a trial of both approaches on a smaller scale to see which yields better results, allowing us to make an informed decision.

## If you were given multiple projects with tight deadlines, how would you prioritize your tasks?

    I would assess each project's urgency and importance by discussing priorities with stakeholders. 
    Then, I would break down the tasks into manageable parts and set milestones.
    I’d also keep open communication with my team to ensure we’re aligned and address any potential bottlenecks early.

## How would you approach a project with an unclear scope?

    I would start by discussing the project with stakeholders to gather their expectations and objectives. 
    If the scope is still ambiguous, I’d propose a phased approach, allowing us to start with a minimum viable product (MVP). 
    This way, we can deliver value incrementally and adjust based on feedback.

## If you received negative feedback from a colleague, how would you handle it?

    I would take a moment to reflect on the feedback before responding. 
    I believe constructive criticism is an opportunity for growth,
    so I would seek clarification on their concerns and discuss ways I could improve. 
    If appropriate, I would implement their suggestions and follow up to show my progress.

## What would you do if you noticed a colleague consistently missing deadlines?

    I would approach my colleague privately and express my concerns in a supportive manner. 
    I’d ask if they are facing any challenges and offer assistance if possible. If the issue persists, 
    I would bring it to the attention of our manager to ensure the team remains on track.
