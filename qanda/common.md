        I’m passionate about automating workflows and improving processes, especially in areas of testing and continuous integration.

        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering from Siddaganga Institute of Technology, 
        where I worked on projects like Speech Emotion Recognition using Python, Django, and TensorFlow, 
        and a minor project on Mask Detection using RNNs. These projects gave me a solid foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.

        As for soft skills, I pride myself on my problem-solving and debugging abilities, 
        and I thrive in collaborative environments, always aiming to be a good team player. Outside of work, 
        I enjoy reading books, keeping up with the latest tech trends, and playing badminton.

## How do you handle tight deadlines?
         
         I handle tight deadlines by prioritizing tasks and maintaining clear communication with my team.
         I break projects into smaller, manageable parts and focus on delivering high-priority items first.
         Staying organized and being flexible in my approach also helps me adapt to any changes that may arise.

## What motivates you in your work?


         I’m motivated by the opportunity to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions.

         Continuous learning and professional growth also drive my passion for technology.


## How do you stay updated with new technologies?
         
         I regularly follow tech blogs, attend webinars, and participate in online courses. 
         I also engage with developer communities on platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow.
         Staying connected with industry trends helps me continuously improve my skills and apply new technologies to my work.


## Where do you see yourself in five years?

      In five years, I see myself in a senior front-end development role, leading projects and mentoring junior developers.
      I also aim to expand my skills in backend technologies and cloud services, possibly moving into full-stack development or architecture. 
      I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects that make a difference.

## What is your greatest weakness?

      I tend to be overly critical of my own work, which can sometimes slow me down. 
      I’m working on this by setting specific timelines for feedback and allowing myself to focus on the positive aspects of my projects.
      I’ve also learned to appreciate the iterative process and seek input from my colleagues.

## What are your greatest strengths?

      One of my greatest strengths is my proficiency in React and TypeScript, which enables me to build efficient and scalable applications. 
      I also excel in problem-solving and debugging, often identifying issues quickly and effectively.
      Additionally, I’m a strong team player who values collaboration and communication.

## Why do you want to work for our company?

      I admire your company’s commitment to innovation and quality in healthcare technology.
      I’m particularly impressed by your recent projects in AI and data analytics. 
      I believe my skills in front-end development and my experience in building robust applications would be a great fit for your team, 
      and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to meaningful solutions.


## What interests you about working with new technologies like Docker or Kubernetes?

      I’m very interested in working with containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools 
      like Kubernetes because they enhance the development workflow and application deployment process.
      They allow for greater scalability and reliability in production environments. 
      I’m eager to deepen my knowledge in these areas as they are becoming increasingly vital in modern software development.


## How do you ensure the security of your applications?

      To ensure the security of my applications, 
      I follow best practices such as input validation, using HTTPS for communication, and implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
      I also keep abreast of common security vulnerabilities, such as those listed in the OWASP Top Ten, and utilize tools like Postman for testing APIs to identify potential security issues.

## What is your approach to debugging issues in your code?

      My approach to debugging involves several steps. First, 
      I reproduce the issue to understand it better. Then, 
      I use tools like Chrome DevTools or console logs to identify where things are going wrong.
      I also check for any recent changes that might have affected the code. If necessary, 
      I utilize version control systems like Git to revert changes or compare different versions. 
      My goal is to understand the root cause, so I can prevent similar issues in the future.

## Can you describe a major project you worked on during your studies?

      My major project was a Speech Emotion Recognition system, where
      I utilized Python and Django for backend development. 
      I employed TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for building the machine learning models that analyzed speech data to detect emotions.
      This project involved significant data analysis and applied various probability techniques to improve the model's accuracy.

## What technologies are you most proficient in?

      I am proficient in several technologies, particularly React and TypeScript for front-end development.
      I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well. Additionally,
      I have experience with Python and REST APIs, which allows me to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end development effectively.

## Tell me about your experience as a front-end software engineer.

      I have 2.5 years of experience as a front-end software engineer at Cerner Oracle. In this role, 
      I maintained the Power Chart application and various JavaScript and Ruby server projects.
      My focus has been on ensuring smooth functionality and a seamless user experience.
      I also created new WebDriverIO tests and automations, and contributed to building Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, which improved our deployment processes.
