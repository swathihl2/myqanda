1. Tell me about yorself ?
        I’m a Front-End Software Engineer with over 2 and a half years of experience at Cerner Oracle. 
        In my role, I’ve gained hands-on expertise in technologies such as React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. I’ve worked extensively on maintaining and enhancing the Power Chart application and have managed several JS and Ruby server projects. 
        I’m also experienced in creating automation tests using WDIO, working on Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, and integrating REST APIs. 
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering from Siddaganga Institute of Technology, where I worked on projects like Speech Emotion Recognition using Python, Django, and TensorFlow, and a minor project on Mask Detection using RNNs.
         These projects gave me a solid foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. On the technical side, 
         I’m highly proficient in React, TypeScript, and Python, and 
         I enjoy working with tools like Git, Jenkins, and Postman. 
         I’ve also worked with AWS for cloud-related tasks, and 
         I’m currently exploring technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, and Spring Boot. 
         I’m passionate about automating workflows and improving processes, especially in areas of testing and continuous integration. As for soft skills, 
         I pride myself on my problem-solving and debugging abilities, and I thrive in collaborative environments, always aiming to be a good team player. Outside of work,
        I enjoy reading books, keeping up with the latest tech trends, and playing badminton.
