Let's go through these Python concepts one by one with answers and examples:

---

### 1. **Explain the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python. How does it affect multi-threading?**
   - **Answer**: The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** is a mechanism that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once in a single process. It effectively makes Python single-threaded for CPU-bound tasks. This is due to Python's memory management, specifically reference counting, which is not thread-safe without the GIL. In multi-threaded programs, only one thread can execute Python code at a time, even on multi-core processors.

     - **Impact on Multi-threading**: The GIL limits the ability to fully utilize multi-core CPUs in multi-threaded Python programs, especially for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., computation-heavy applications). However, multi-threading can still be effective for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file I/O, network requests), where threads spend time waiting for external operations.

   - **Follow-up**: **What are some ways to work around the GIL for multi-core processors in Python?**
     - **Answer**: 
       - **Multiprocessing**: One common approach is using the `multiprocessing` module, which spawns separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and GIL. This allows true parallelism, as each process runs on a different CPU core.
       - **Cython**: You can also write performance-critical code in Cython, which allows you to release the GIL when performing CPU-bound tasks.
       - **External Libraries**: Use libraries like **NumPy**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch**, which can release the GIL for computational tasks by using C extensions and multi-threading internally.

---

### 2. **What is a Python decorator, and how do they work?**
   - **Answer**: A **decorator** is a function that takes another function (or method) and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it. Decorators are commonly used for logging, access control, memoization, and other cross-cutting concerns.

     Decorators work by wrapping the original function with additional code and returning a new function. This can be done using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

     Example:
     ```python
     def my_decorator(func):
         def wrapper():
             print("Before the function call")
             func()
             print("After the function call")
         return wrapper

     @my_decorator
     def say_hello():
         print("Hello!")

     say_hello()
     ```

     Output:
     ```
     Before the function call
     Hello!
     After the function call
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you write a decorator to cache the results of a function (memoization)?**
     - **Answer**: Here's an example of a memoization decorator using a dictionary to cache results:
     ```python
     def memoize(func):
         cache = {}
         def wrapper(*args):
             if args in cache:
                 return cache[args]
             result = func(*args)
             cache[args] = result
             return result
         return wrapper

     @memoize
     def slow_function(x):
         print(f"Computing {x}...")
         return x * 2

     print(slow_function(4))  # Computes and caches
     print(slow_function(4))  # Retrieves from cache
     ```

---

### 3. **Explain the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`. When would you use each?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **`@staticmethod`**: This decorator defines a method that does not access the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`). It's a method that belongs to the class but doesn't operate on the instance or class variables.
     - **`@classmethod`**: This decorator defines a method that takes the class (`cls`) as its first argument, instead of the instance (`self`). It's used when you need to modify class-level attributes or need to create factory methods that instantiate the class in different ways.

     Example:
     ```python
     class MyClass:
         @staticmethod
         def static_method():
             print("This is a static method.")

         @classmethod
         def class_method(cls):
             print(f"This is a class method for {cls}.")

     MyClass.static_method()  # No class or instance required
     MyClass.class_method()   # Called on the class itself
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Provide examples of when to use both and how they differ in behavior.**
     - **Answer**:
       - **Use `@staticmethod`**: When the method doesn't need access to instance or class data, but logically belongs to the class.
         Example: Utility functions that are related to the class but do not require object state.
       - **Use `@classmethod`**: When the method needs to modify or access class-level attributes, or when you want to provide alternative constructors (factory methods).
         Example: A factory method to instantiate a class in a specific way.
         ```python
         class Person:
             def __init__(self, name):
                 self.name = name

             @classmethod
             def from_string(cls, name_str):
                 name = name_str.split(" ")[0]
                 return cls(name)

         p = Person.from_string("John Doe")
         ```

---

### 4. **What is the purpose of the `__init__`, `__del__`, and `__new__` methods in Python classes?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **`__init__`**: The **initializer** method is called when an object is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes.
     - **`__new__`**: The **constructor** method is called before `__init__`. It is responsible for creating the new object (it returns the object instance), and is used primarily when working with metaclasses or singleton patterns.
     - **`__del__`**: The **destructor** method is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to release resources like closing files or database connections.

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you explain the order of execution when creating a new object and the potential use cases for each?**
     - **Answer**: 
       - **`__new__`** is called first (when creating an object), which is responsible for allocating memory and creating the instance.
       - **`__init__`** is called after the object is created and is used for setting up initial states.
       - **`__del__`** is called when the object is about to be destroyed, usually when there are no more references to it (i.e., when it is garbage collected).

     Example:
     ```python
     class MyClass:
         def __new__(cls):
             print("Creating instance")
             return super().__new__(cls)

         def __init__(self):
             print("Initializing instance")

         def __del__(self):
             print("Destroying instance")

     obj = MyClass()  # Calls __new__ and __init__
     del obj           # Calls __del__
     ```

---

### 5. **How does Python handle memory management, particularly reference counting and garbage collection?**
   - **Answer**: Python uses two mechanisms for memory management:
     - **Reference Counting**: Every object in Python has an associated reference count. When an object's reference count drops to zero (i.e., no more references to the object), it is eligible for garbage collection.
     - **Garbage Collection**: Python uses a cyclic garbage collector (part of the `gc` module) to detect and collect objects involved in reference cycles (e.g., objects that reference each other in a cycle).

   - **Follow-up**: **How can you track memory leaks in Python?**
     - **Answer**: You can use the `gc` module to track objects that are not being garbage collected due to reference cycles. For more detailed memory profiling, you can use third-party tools like:
       - **`objgraph`**: For visualizing object references and finding memory leaks.
       - **`memory_profiler`**: For monitoring memory usage during program execution.
       - **`tracemalloc`**: For tracking memory allocations in Python.

     Example of using `gc`:
     ```python
     import gc
     gc.collect()  # Forces a garbage collection cycle
     ```
Sure! Let's continue with the answers for the next set of questions:

---

### 6. **What is the difference between `deepcopy` and `copy` in Python?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - **`copy`**: The `copy.copy()` function performs a shallow copy of an object. It creates a new object, but if the object contains references to other objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries), those references are copied, not the objects themselves.
     - **`deepcopy`**: The `copy.deepcopy()` function creates a deep copy of an object, meaning it recursively copies all objects within the original object, ensuring that all referenced objects are copied as well (not just the references).

     Example:
     ```python
     import copy

     original = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
     shallow = copy.copy(original)
     deep = copy.deepcopy(original)

     original[0][0] = 99

     print(original)  # [[99, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
     print(shallow)   # [[99, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] (reference shared)
     print(deep)       # [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] (deep copied)
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you provide an example where `copy` would fail but `deepcopy` works?**
     - **Answer**: If the object has nested mutable objects, a shallow copy (`copy.copy()`) will only copy references to the nested objects, causing unexpected behavior when modifying the copy.
     
     Example:
     ```python
     original = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]}
     shallow = copy.copy(original)

     original['a'][0] = 99
     print(original)  # {'a': [99, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]}
     print(shallow)   # {'a': [99, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]} (nested list modified as well)

     deep = copy.deepcopy(original)
     original['a'][1] = 88
     print(deep)       # {'a': [99, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]} (deepcopy unaffected)
     ```

### 7. **How does Python handle type annotations and type checking?**
   - **Answer**: Python allows optional type annotations to provide hints about the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values. Type annotations help with readability and can be used by type checkers, IDEs, and linters.

     Python's type system is dynamic, meaning it doesn't enforce type checks at runtime, but tools like **`mypy`** can be used for static type checking.

     Example:
     ```python
     def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
         return a + b

     result = add_numbers(5, 10)  # Correct
     # result = add_numbers("5", 10)  # Type error detected by `mypy`
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **What is the `mypy` tool, and how does it relate to static type checking in Python?**
     - **Answer**: `mypy` is a static type checker for Python that checks type annotations. It can be run from the command line to analyze Python files and ensure that types match the specified annotations. `mypy` is not built into Python and must be installed separately.
     
     Example:
     ```bash
     pip install mypy
     mypy script.py
     ```

---

### 8. **What is the difference between `__slots__` and regular class attributes?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - **`__slots__`**: The `__slots__` mechanism allows you to explicitly declare which attributes an object can have. This reduces memory usage by preventing the creation of a `__dict__` for the object, which stores all instance attributes.
     - **Regular Class Attributes**: By default, each instance of a Python class has a `__dict__` attribute that stores the object's attributes. This allows dynamic addition of attributes, but also consumes more memory.

     Example:
     ```python
     class MyClass:
         __slots__ = ['name', 'age']

     obj = MyClass()
     obj.name = 'John'
     obj.age = 30
     # obj.city = 'New York'  # This will raise an AttributeError because 'city' is not in __slots__
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **How do `__slots__` help in optimizing memory usage for large objects?**
     - **Answer**: By using `__slots__`, Python objects do not need to store instance attributes in the `__dict__`, reducing memory overhead. This is especially beneficial when creating a large number of objects where each object has only a few fixed attributes.

     Example:
     ```python
     class Point:
         __slots__ = ['x', 'y']

     p1 = Point()
     p1.x = 10
     p1.y = 20
     # No __dict__ is created for Point instances, saving memory
     ```

### 9. **What are the different ways to handle exceptions in Python? Explain the usage of custom exceptions.**
   - **Answer**: 
     - Python handles exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.
     - You can create **custom exceptions** by subclassing the built-in `Exception` class. Custom exceptions allow for more specific error handling, improving clarity in complex applications.

     Example:
     ```python
     class MyError(Exception):
         pass

     try:
         raise MyError("Something went wrong")
     except MyError as e:
         print(f"Custom error occurred: {e}")
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you show an example of a custom exception and how it might be used in a real-world application?**
     - **Answer**: Example of a custom exception used in a real-world scenario:
     ```python
     class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
         def __init__(self, balance, amount):
             self.balance = balance
             self.amount = amount

     class BankAccount:
         def __init__(self, balance):
             self.balance = balance

         def withdraw(self, amount):
             if amount > self.balance:
                 raise InsufficientFundsError(self.balance, amount)
             self.balance -= amount
             print(f"Withdrew {amount}, balance is now {self.balance}")

     account = BankAccount(100)
     try:
         account.withdraw(150)
     except InsufficientFundsError as e:
         print(f"Error: Attempted to withdraw {e.amount}, but only {e.balance} is available.")
     ```

### 10. **What are Python generators, and how do they differ from regular functions?**
   - **Answer**: A **generator** is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values lazily (on-demand). Instead of returning all values at once like a regular function, a generator yields one value at a time using the `yield` keyword.

     - **Difference from Regular Functions**: 
       - Regular functions return values immediately using `return`.
       - Generators use `yield` and can produce values one at a time, pausing and resuming their execution between yields.

     Example:
     ```python
     def fibonacci():
         a, b = 0, 1
         while True:
             yield a
             a, b = b, a + b

     fib = fibonacci()
     for _ in range(5):
         print(next(fib))  # Prints the first 5 Fibonacci numbers
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you write a generator function to yield Fibonacci numbers indefinitely?**
     - **Answer**: The Fibonacci sequence generator already shown is an example of an infinite generator. It continues to yield Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
     ```python
     def fibonacci():
         a, b = 0, 1
         while True:
             yield a
             a, b = b, a + b

     fib = fibonacci()
     for _ in range(10):  # Print first 10 Fibonacci numbers
         print(next(fib))
     ```


### 11. **What are metaclasses in Python, and how do they work?**
   - **Answer**: 
     A **metaclass** in Python is a class of a class. In other words, it defines how classes themselves behave. Metaclasses are responsible for creating classes, similar to how classes are responsible for creating instances. Every class in Python is an instance of a metaclass, and you can customize this process to control class creation and behavior.

     **How they work**: 
     - When a class is created, Python uses a metaclass to create it.
     - You can modify the behavior of class creation, method resolution order, inheritance, and more by customizing the metaclass.

     Example:
     ```python
     class Meta(type):  # Custom metaclass
         def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
             print(f"Creating class {name}")
             return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

     class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):
         pass
     
     # Output: Creating class MyClass
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you give an example of when to use a metaclass to modify class behavior?**
     - **Answer**: 
       A common use case for metaclasses is enforcing class-level constraints or automatically adding functionality. For example, you might use a metaclass to ensure that all class methods in a class are decorated with a specific decorator, or to dynamically add logging functionality.

       Example:
       ```python
       class MethodLoggerMeta(type):
           def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
               for key, value in dct.items():
                   if callable(value):
                       # Wrap methods to log function calls
                       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                           print(f"Calling {key} with {args}, {kwargs}")
                           return value(*args, **kwargs)
                       dct[key] = wrapper
               return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

       class MyClass(metaclass=MethodLoggerMeta):
           def greet(self, name):
               return f"Hello, {name}"

       obj = MyClass()
       obj.greet("John")  # Output: Calling greet with ('John',), {}
       ```

### 12. **How would you optimize the performance of a Python application that heavily relies on database queries?**
   - **Answer**: 
     To optimize a Python application that interacts with a database, you can employ several strategies:

     1. **Caching**: Cache the results of frequently accessed queries using libraries like **`redis`** or **`memcached`** to avoid hitting the database repeatedly for the same data.
     2. **Connection Pooling**: Use a connection pool (e.g., **`SQLAlchemy`**, **`psycopg2`**) to maintain a pool of reusable database connections, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying connections for each query.
     3. **Batch Queries**: Instead of making multiple single queries, batch them together into a single query or use **`bulk_insert()`** or similar techniques for bulk operations.
     4. **Indexing**: Make sure your database is properly indexed to speed up searches and lookups.
     5. **Lazy Loading and Pagination**: If you're dealing with large data sets, use pagination or lazy loading to fetch data incrementally instead of all at once.

   - **Follow-up**: **What strategies would you use to reduce latency in database calls, such as caching or connection pooling?**
     - **Answer**: 
       - **Caching**: Cache query results in a local cache (e.g., `redis` or `memcached`) to avoid redundant database calls. For read-heavy applications, this can significantly reduce load times.
       - **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to keep a pool of database connections open, so you don't have to wait for a new connection to be created for every request.
       - **Asynchronous Queries**: For I/O-bound operations, use asynchronous queries with `asyncio` to allow other tasks to run while waiting for the database response.
       - **Prepared Statements**: Use prepared statements for repeated queries to reduce parsing and planning time on the database side.

---

### 13. **Explain the differences between `asyncio`, `threading`, and `multiprocessing` in Python.**
   - **Answer**: 
     - **`asyncio`**: A library for writing concurrent code using the `async`/`await` syntax. It uses a single thread to manage multiple tasks asynchronously. Ideal for I/O-bound tasks where waiting for external resources (like HTTP requests or database queries) can be overlapped without blocking.
     - **`threading`**: The threading module is used for concurrent execution in the form of threads. Threads run concurrently in the same memory space. It's typically used for I/O-bound tasks, but Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit CPU-bound performance improvements.
     - **`multiprocessing`**: The multiprocessing module creates separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. It bypasses the GIL and is ideal for CPU-bound tasks, where parallelism is needed to speed up computation-heavy operations.

   - **Follow-up**: **When would you prefer using `asyncio` over `multiprocessing` or `threading`?**
     - **Answer**: 
       - **Use `asyncio`** when your application is I/O-bound, such as making many network requests, reading from or writing to files, or interacting with databases. `asyncio` is well-suited for managing multiple I/O operations concurrently in a single-threaded environment.
       - **Use `multiprocessing`** when you need to parallelize CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation (e.g., scientific computing, data processing) across multiple cores.
       - **Use `threading`** for situations where you need concurrent tasks but without significant CPU load, such as managing multiple tasks that involve I/O-bound operations and can benefit from concurrency within a single thread.

---

### 14. **What is the purpose of the `with` statement in Python, and how does context management work?**
   - **Answer**: 
     The `with` statement in Python is used for **context management**. It simplifies the management of resources (like files, network connections, or locks), ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up after use, even in the case of errors or exceptions.

     - The context manager defines two methods:
       1. `__enter__`: Called when the `with` block is entered. It handles any setup or resource allocation.
       2. `__exit__`: Called when the `with` block is exited. It handles cleanup, such as closing files or releasing locks.

     Example:
     ```python
     with open('example.txt', 'w') as f:
         f.write('Hello, world!')  # The file is automatically closed after exiting the block.
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you create a custom context manager using the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods?**
     - **Answer**: Yes, you can create a custom context manager by defining a class with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods.
     
     Example:
     ```python
     class MyContextManager:
         def __enter__(self):
             print("Entering the context")
             return self  # Return value can be anything useful (e.g., file handler)
         
         def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
             print("Exiting the context")
             # Cleanup actions here

     with MyContextManager():
         print("Inside the context")
     
     # Output:
     # Entering the context
     # Inside the context
     # Exiting the context
     ```

---

### 15. **How do you ensure that a Python program is thread-safe when multiple threads are interacting with shared data?**
   - **Answer**: 
     To ensure thread-safety when multiple threads access shared data, you can use synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions:
     - **Locks**: Use the `threading.Lock()` to create a lock around critical sections of code where shared resources are modified. Only one thread can acquire the lock at a time, ensuring that the shared resource is accessed in a controlled manner.
     - **Semaphores**: A semaphore limits the number of threads that can access a shared resource at a time. It is useful when you have a limited number of resources that multiple threads can share.
     - **RLocks (Reentrant Locks)**: Similar to a `Lock`, but allows a thread to acquire the lock multiple times without deadlocking.
     - **Condition Variables**: Used for signaling between threads, allowing threads to wait for certain conditions to be met before continuing.

   - **Follow-up**: **Explain the role of locks, semaphores, and other synchronization mechanisms in thread-safe programming.**
     - **Answer**: 
       - **Locks** ensure that only one thread at a time can access critical sections of the code, preventing race conditions where multiple threads try to modify the same resource concurrently.
       - **Semaphores** allow multiple threads to access a shared resource, but limit the number of threads that can do so at once, ensuring that resources are not overloaded.
       - **Condition Variables** allow threads to communicate with each other, waiting for a certain condition to be true before proceeding.
       - **Queues** provide thread-safe mechanisms for passing data between threads, helping to avoid direct access to shared data.

     Example using a lock:
     ```python
     import threading

     shared_data = 0
     lock = threading.Lock()

     def

 increment():
         global shared_data
         with lock:
             shared_data += 1

     threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(1000)]

     ```

Here are the answers to the next set of questions:

### 16. **What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - **`==`**: This checks for **value equality**. It evaluates whether the values of two objects are the same, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.
     - **`is`**: This checks for **identity equality**. It evaluates whether two references point to the same object in memory, meaning they are the exact same instance.

     Example:
     ```python
     a = [1, 2, 3]
     b = [1, 2, 3]

     print(a == b)  # True (values are equal)
     print(a is b)  # False (they are different objects in memory)
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you give an example where using `is` would cause an error but `==` would not?**
     - **Answer**: 
       `is` should not be used for value comparisons, especially with immutable objects like integers and strings in Python, because it checks for identity (memory location), not value. This can lead to unexpected results when comparing objects with the same value but different identities.

       Example:
       ```python
       a = [1, 2, 3]
       b = a.copy()

       print(a == b)  # True (values are equal)
       print(a is b)  # False (they are different objects in memory)
       ```

       Using `is` incorrectly would cause a failure when comparing objects that have the same value but are not the same instance.

### 17. **How would you implement a custom iterator in Python?**
   - **Answer**: 
     To implement a custom iterator in Python, you need to define a class that implements two key methods:
     - `__iter__()` which returns the iterator object itself.
     - `__next__()` which returns the next item in the sequence and raises `StopIteration` when the sequence is exhausted.

     Example of a custom iterator that returns the squares of numbers in a given range:
     ```python
     class SquareIterator:
         def __init__(self, start, end):
             self.start = start
             self.end = end
             self.current = start

         def __iter__(self):
             return self

         def __next__(self):
             if self.current >= self.end:
                 raise StopIteration
             square = self.current ** 2
             self.current += 1
             return square

     # Usage:
     squares = SquareIterator(1, 5)
     for square in squares:
         print(square)
     # Output: 1, 4, 9, 16
     ```

   - **Follow-up**: **Write an iterator class that returns the squares of numbers in a given range.**
     - **Answer**: The above example already provides an iterator class that returns the squares of numbers in a given range. When instantiated with a start and end value, the iterator computes the squares of numbers and returns them one by one until the end is reached.

### 18. **What are Python's built-in data structures, and how do you decide when to use each one (e.g., list, tuple, set, dict)?**
   - **Answer**: 
     Python offers several built-in data structures, each with specific use cases:

     1. **List**: A mutable, ordered collection of items. Lists are ideal when you need to store and manipulate a sequence of items. Use when order matters and you may need to modify the collection.
        - Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
     2. **Tuple**: An immutable, ordered collection of items. Tuples are best used when you want to store a fixed sequence of items that should not be modified.
        - Example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`
     3. **Set**: An unordered collection of unique items. Sets are useful when you need to store elements without duplicates and do not care about the order.
        - Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`
     4. **Dictionary (dict)**: A mutable, unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are ideal when you need to associate keys with values and perform fast lookups based on keys.
        - Example: `my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}`

   - **Follow-up**: **When would you choose a `deque` over a list, and what performance advantages does it offer?**
     - **Answer**: 
       - A `deque` (double-ended queue) is a specialized data structure in the `collections` module. It is optimized for adding and removing elements from both ends with **O(1)** time complexity.
       - **When to use `deque` over a list**:
         - If you need to append or pop items from both the front and back of the collection, `deque` is more efficient.
         - Lists are slower for these operations because they have to shift elements when appending or popping from the front, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
     
     Example:
     ```python
     from collections import deque

     d = deque([1, 2, 3])
     d.appendleft(0)  # O(1)
     d.append(4)      # O(1)
     d.pop()          # O(1)
     d.popleft()      # O(1)
     ```

     Lists, on the other hand, are better for operations like random access (`list[index]`), where performance is typically O(1), but for efficient appending and popping from both ends, `deque` is the better choice.

### 19. **What is the difference between `functools.lru_cache` and `memoization`? How would you implement your own cache mechanism?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - **`functools.lru_cache`** is a built-in decorator in Python that implements **Least Recently Used (LRU) caching**. It caches the results of function calls based on the arguments, and when the cache reaches a certain size, it removes the least recently used items.
     - **Memoization** is a broader concept of caching the results of function calls to improve performance, where the goal is to avoid redundant calculations for the same inputs.

     The key difference is that `lru_cache` has an LRU eviction policy, whereas memoization might not have a limit on the number of cached results.

   - **Follow-up**: **How does the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm work in Python’s `lru_cache` decorator?**
     - **Answer**: 
       The **LRU algorithm** evicts the least recently used items from the cache when the cache exceeds a specified size. When a function is called with the same arguments, the result is retrieved from the cache. If the cache reaches its size limit, the function call that was least recently accessed is removed to make space for new entries.

     Example:
     ```python
     from functools import lru_cache

     @lru_cache(maxsize=3)
     def slow_function(n):
         print(f"Computing {n}...")
         return n * 2

     print(slow_function(1))  # Computing 1... 2
     print(slow_function(2))  # Computing 2... 4
     print(slow_function(3))  # Computing 3... 6
     print(slow_function(1))  # Cached result: 2
     print(slow_function(4))  # Computing 4... 8 (LRU eviction)
     ```

### 20. **What is the purpose of the `itertools` module in Python?**
   - **Answer**: 
     The `itertools` module provides fast, memory-efficient tools for working with iterators. It offers a set of building blocks for constructing iterators that operate on items of a sequence (e.g., lists, tuples, or generators). These tools are particularly useful when working with large datasets or streams of data because they allow you to process items one at a time without needing to store them all in memory.

     **Some key functions** in `itertools`:
     - `count`: Generates an infinite sequence of numbers.
     - `cycle`: Cycles through an iterable indefinitely.
     - `chain`: Combines multiple iterables into one.
     - `combinations`, `permutations`, and `product`: Generate combinations, permutations, or Cartesian products of input iterables.

   - **Follow-up**: **Can you provide examples where `itertools.combinations`, `itertools.permutations`, or `itertools.product` would be useful?**
     - **Answer**: 
       - **`itertools.combinations`**: Useful when you need all possible combinations of a certain length from a sequence.
         Example: 
         ```python
         from itertools import combinations

         items = [1, 2, 3]
         for comb in combinations(items, 2):
             print(comb)
         # Output: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)
         ```
       - **`itertools.permutations`**: Useful when you need all possible permutations of a sequence.
         Example:
         ```python
         from itertools import permutations

         items = [1, 2, 3]
         for perm in permutations(items):
             print(perm)
         # Output: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 

2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)
         ```
       - **`itertools.product`**: Useful for generating the Cartesian product (all possible combinations) of multiple iterables.
         Example:
         ```python
         from itertools import product

         colors = ['red', 'blue']
         sizes = ['small', 'large']
         for combo in product(colors, sizes):
             print(combo)
         # Output: ('red', 'small'), ('red', 'large'), ('blue', 'small'), ('blue', 'large')
         ```
