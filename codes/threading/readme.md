## Choosing Between Concurrency and Parallelism in Python
Concurrency is useful when you have I/O-bound tasks and you want to efficiently handle many tasks at once without waiting for each one to finish. Use asyncio or threading for such tasks.
Parallelism is useful when you have CPU-bound tasks and want to take advantage of multiple cores. Use multiprocessing for true parallelism.

---------

## Conclusion
Concurrency allows you to manage multiple tasks at once by interleaving their execution, making it ideal for I/O-bound tasks.
Parallelism involves executing multiple tasks at the same time on multiple CPU cores, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks.
In Python, we can implement concurrency with threading or asyncio, and parallelism with multiprocessing.

## Comparison Between Concurrency and Parallelism

| **Aspect**            | **Concurrency**                                      | **Parallelism**                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Dealing with multiple tasks at once (time-sharing)   | Executing multiple tasks simultaneously (hardware parallelism) |
| **Execution Model**   | Tasks are interleaved on a single core               | Tasks run simultaneously on multiple cores           |
| **Use Case**          | I/O-bound tasks (file reading, network requests)     | CPU-bound tasks (mathematical calculations, data processing) |
| **Python Limitation** | GIL limits CPU-bound tasks (threads)                 | GIL is bypassed (multiple processes can run in parallel) |
| **Example**           | Threading (`threading` module)                       | Multiprocessing (`multiprocessing` module)           |
