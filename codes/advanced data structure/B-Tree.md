## B-Tree

A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. It is commonly used in databases and file systems.

B-Tree is an ordered tree with nodes that can have multiple children (a generalization of a binary tree).
It is balanced, ensuring that operations like search, insertion, and deletion take logarithmic time.
Example: B-Tree Implementation (Simplified)

```python

# This is a simplified example of a B-Tree implementation in Python.
# A full B-Tree implementation would require more complexity.

class BTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, leaf=False):
        self.keys = []
        self.children = []
        self.leaf = leaf

class BTree:
    def __init__(self, t):
        self.root = BTreeNode(leaf=True)
        self.t = t  # Minimum degree of the B-Tree

    def insert(self, key):
        root = self.root
        if len(root.keys) == 2 * self.t - 1:
            new_node = BTreeNode()
            self.root = new_node
            new_node.children.append(root)
            self.split(new_node, 0)
        self.insert_non_full(self.root, key)

    def split(self, node, index):
        t = self.t
        new_node = BTreeNode(leaf=node.children[index].leaf)
        node.children[index].keys = node.children[index].keys[t - 1:]
        node.children[index].children = node.children[index].children[t:]
        node.children[index].keys = node.children[index].keys[:t - 1]
        node.children[index].children = node.children[index].children[:t]
        
    def insert_non_full(self, node, key):
        # Inserting a key into a non-full node
        pass  # This part involves more detailed logic for proper insertion

# Creating and using a B-tree would involve more code

```

Explanation:

B-Trees are used in systems where large amounts of data need to be stored efficiently.
They ensure that search operations remain logarithmic in time complexity even with large data sets, making them ideal for database indexes
