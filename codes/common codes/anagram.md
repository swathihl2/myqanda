An **anagram** is when two strings have the exact same characters, but possibly in a different order. To check if two strings are anagrams, the two strings must:

1. Have the same length.
2. Contain the same characters with the same frequency.

### Different Approaches to Check if Two Strings are Anagrams

Here are various ways to check if two strings are anagrams in Python:

---

### 1. **Using Sorting (Simple and Intuitive)**

The simplest way to check if two strings are anagrams is to **sort both strings** and then compare them. If both sorted strings are identical, they are anagrams.

```python
def are_anagrams(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)

# Example usage
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("hello", "world"))    # Output: False
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the strings (due to the sorting step).  
**Space Complexity**: O(n), for the sorted lists.

This method is simple but not the most optimized for large strings due to the sorting step.

---

### 2. **Using `collections.Counter` (Efficient)**

A more efficient approach is to use **`collections.Counter`**, which counts the frequency of each character in both strings. If both strings have the same character frequencies, they are anagrams.

```python
from collections import Counter

def are_anagrams(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    return Counter(str1) == Counter(str2)

# Example usage
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("hello", "world"))    # Output: False
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the strings (since `Counter` processes the strings in linear time).  
**Space Complexity**: O(n), for the frequency counts.

This method is faster than sorting, especially for larger strings, since it operates in linear time.

---

### 3. **Using a Dictionary (Manual Frequency Count)**

If you don't want to use `Counter` (e.g., for educational purposes or to avoid importing additional libraries), you can manually count the frequencies of characters using a dictionary.

```python
def are_anagrams(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return False
    
    freq1 = {}
    freq2 = {}
    
    for char in str1:
        freq1[char] = freq1.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in str2:
        freq2[char] = freq2.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    return freq1 == freq2

# Example usage
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("hello", "world"))    # Output: False
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the strings (since we iterate through the strings once).  
**Space Complexity**: O(n), for the frequency dictionaries.

This method is similar to using `Counter` but gives you more control over the frequency counting process.

---

### 4. **Using Sorting Without `sorted()` (Manual Approach)**

If you want to avoid the overhead of sorting and prefer to implement the comparison yourself, you can manually compare the characters of the two strings. This is a more involved approach.

```python
def are_anagrams(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return False
    
    # Convert strings to lists for in-place modification
    str1_list = list(str1)
    str2_list = list(str2)
    
    # Sort the lists manually
    str1_list.sort()
    str2_list.sort()
    
    return str1_list == str2_list

# Example usage
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("hello", "world"))    # Output: False
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n), due to the sorting step.  
**Space Complexity**: O(n), for the lists created.

This method is essentially equivalent to the first method but avoids the use of the `sorted()` function, and gives you more flexibility in terms of implementation.

---

### 5. **Using a Single Pass with Frequency Comparison (Optimized)**

An even more optimized approach that avoids sorting or constructing additional data structures (except for a frequency dictionary) is to perform the comparison in a **single pass**. This method ensures that we only iterate through the strings once.

```python
def are_anagrams(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return False
    
    freq = {}
    
    for char in str1:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in str2:
        if char not in freq or freq[char] == 0:
            return False
        freq[char] -= 1
    
    return True

# Example usage
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("hello", "world"))    # Output: False
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the strings (since we iterate over both strings only once).  
**Space Complexity**: O(n), for the frequency dictionary.

This method is optimal in terms of both time and space, performing a single pass over the strings while maintaining the character frequency count.

---

### Summary of Methods:

1. **Using Sorting**: Simple, but **O(n log n)** time complexity due to sorting.
2. **Using `collections.Counter`**: Efficient and easy to implement with **O(n)** time complexity.
3. **Using a Dictionary**: Manual frequency count method with **O(n)** time complexity.
4. **Manual Sorting**: Similar to sorting approach but done manually, still with **O(n log n)** time complexity.
5. **Single Pass with Frequency Comparison**: The most **optimized method** with **O(n)** time complexity, good for large strings.

### Best Option:

- **For small to moderate-sized strings**, **`collections.Counter`** is the easiest and most efficient approach in terms of readability and performance.
- **For very large strings**, the **single pass with frequency comparison** method is the most optimal in terms of both time and space complexity.
