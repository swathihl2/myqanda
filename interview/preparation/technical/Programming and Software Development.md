### 1. **Explain the differences between procedural programming and object-oriented programming.**

| **Aspect**                 | **Procedural Programming**                                  | **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**                        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fundamental Concept**     | Focuses on **functions** or **procedures**                   | Focuses on **objects** that are instances of **classes**     |
| **Data and Functions**      | Data and functions are separate                             | Data and functions (methods) are encapsulated within objects |
| **State and Behavior**      | State (data) and behavior (functions) are separate          | State (attributes) and behavior (methods) are bundled in objects |
| **Modularity and Reusability** | Functions can be reused, but may become hard to maintain as complexity grows | Objects and classes are modular and reusable through inheritance and polymorphism |
| **Abstraction**             | Achieved by hiding logic within functions                    | Achieved through classes, which expose only necessary details via public methods |
| **Code Organization**       | Organized into functions and global variables               | Organized into objects and classes representing real-world entities |
| **Approach to Problem-Solving** | Top-down approach: start from the overall task, break it into smaller tasks (functions) | Bottom-up approach: model real-world entities and their interactions |
| **Example**                 | ```c\nint calculateArea(int width, int height) {\nreturn width * height;\n}``` | ```python\nclass Rectangle:\n def __init__(self, width, height):\n self.width = width\n self.height = height\n def calculate_area(self):\n return self.width * self.height\n``` |
| **Advantages**              | Simpler and more straightforward for small programs; faster for simple tasks | Better suited for large, complex systems; easier maintenance and extension; encourages modularity and data protection |
| **Disadvantages**           | Can become messy and hard to maintain for larger programs; lacks data protection | Can introduce unnecessary complexity for small tasks; requires more initial design work |
| **Common Use Cases**        | Small programs, scripts, simple algorithms                   | Large systems, GUI applications, games, enterprise software |
| **Examples of Languages**   | C, Pascal, Fortran, BASIC                                  | Java, C++, Python, C#, Ruby, Swift                           |

### 2. **How does React.js handle state management? Can you describe the role of hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`?**

In React, state is used to track data that changes over time, like user inputs or API responses. 

- **`useState`**: Used to declare state in functional components. It allows you to create state variables and update them.

- 
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
    ```
    `count` is the state variable, and `setCount` is the function to update it.

- **`useEffect`**: Used to handle side effects like fetching data, setting up event listeners, or cleaning up resources after a component is rendered.

- 
  - **Example**:
    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      fetchData();
    }, []); // Fetch data when the component mounts
    ```

### 3. **Walk us through how you would set up a CI/CD pipeline for a React.js application.**

To set up a CI/CD pipeline for React:

1. **Set up version control** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. **Choose a CI/CD service** (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI).
3. **Write configuration**:
   - Create a YAML file for the CI/CD workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for GitHub Actions).
   - Install dependencies (`npm install`).
   - Run tests (`npm test`).
   - Build the app (`npm run build`).
4. **Deploy**:
   - Automatically deploy the built app to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
5. **Set triggers**: Configure triggers like pushing to a branch or merging pull requests to start the pipeline.

### 4. **How would you optimize the performance of a React app? Provide specific examples.**

1. **Memoize components**: Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - **Example**:  
     ```javascript
     const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
       return <div>{props.data}</div>;
     });
     ```

2. **Use `useCallback` and `useMemo`**: Memoize functions and calculations to avoid unnecessary re-computations.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
     ```

3. **Lazy load components**: Use `React.lazy` to load components only when needed.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
     ```

4. **Use `react-window` for large lists**: This optimizes large lists by rendering only visible items.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     <List height={150} itemCount={items.length} itemSize={35} width={300}>
       {({ index, style }) => <div style={style}>{items[index]}</div>}
     </List>
     ```

### 5. **What are the key principles of API integration in modern web applications?**

- **RESTful APIs**: Most web apps use REST APIs, which follow principles like stateless communication, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and exchanging data in JSON format.
- **Authentication**: Use tokens (like JWT) for secure communication between client and server.
- **Error handling**: APIs should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server issues).
- **Rate limiting**: To prevent abuse, limit the number of requests from clients within a time period.
- **Versioning**: APIs are often versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/`), so updates won’t break the client app.

### 6. **Can you explain the purpose of the virtual DOM in React.js and how it improves performance?**

The **virtual DOM** is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the real DOM, which can be slow. When state changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, compares it to the real DOM (using a "diffing" algorithm), and then applies only the necessary updates to the real DOM.

This reduces expensive DOM operations and results in faster rendering and updates.

---

### 7. **Discuss a time you optimized an application’s performance. What steps did you take?**

**Example Answer**:
In a project, I noticed the app was slow when rendering large lists of data. To optimize:
1. I used **virtualization** (`react-window`) to render only visible items in the list.
2. I **memoized** components with `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
3. I implemented **lazy loading** for components that weren’t immediately needed on the page.

This reduced load times and improved the overall user experience.

### 8. **What are some challenges you’ve faced with cross-browser compatibility, and how did you resolve them?**

**Challenge**: The app wasn't displaying properly in older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer).
**Solution**:
1. I used **CSS prefixes** (via tools like Autoprefixer) to ensure compatibility with older browser versions.
2. For JavaScript, I used **Babel** to transpile code and support older browsers.
3. I tested the app on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) using tools like BrowserStack and made adjustments as needed, like adding polyfills for missing features.
