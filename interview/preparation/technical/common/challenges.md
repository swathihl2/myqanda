### 2. **Can you describe a challenging UI issue you faced and how you resolved it?**

**Challenge**:
1. **Zero-width space issues in footnote tags**: 
   - I had trouble finding hidden spaces in footnotes that were causing layout problems. To fix it, I had to carefully debug the code and look for these invisible spaces that were messing up the design.

2. **CSS compatibility across different browsers**:
   - Some styles weren't working well in Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. I had to adjust the CSS so that it looked good across different browsers, making sure the layout appeared consistent.

3. **Dropdown list issue while tagging footnotes**:
   - The dropdown list wasnâ€™t working correctly when tagging footnotes and the data missing behind the scene. I investigated the issue, found what was causing it, and made the necessary adjustments to get it functioning properly.

4. **Investigating Terraform component compatibility**:
   - There were some problems with how different Terraform components worked together. I spent time researching the compatibility issues, tested different configurations, and made sure everything worked smoothly.
