# 1) Explain the key steps involved in upgrading Ruby engines to 3.3.

# 2) Explain how you implemented the auto-save functionality in PowerChart.

every fresh start
settings api, 
cache to avoid repeated api call 
wrapping the doms and pulling the props


To 
Implement that as a functionality. 
We did like this one. 
And ask from the customer is like uh whenever the page is reloaded. 
Uh, reloaded, so the 
They said uh back in settings API should be called, so from the settings API I will be getting the to say function whether it is enabled or disabled, so that 
enabled our disabled flag will be saved into a cashier, and that cachet, we are referring every time when the page is loaded. 
So, and for this one, I introduced the new property from every uh object and the document so I can be pulled from every time when it will be loaded, so it made us some challenging task to introduce those property when uh new feature came and we used some of the flags to avoid an unwanted um use cases like 
Uh, um. 
So 
He was at a a loaded it to to the pages at a time, uh, simultaneously so that time we some flag for a locking the cache overriding the um. 
And uh this one. So, yeah, all these things we had a challenging challenges we faced when we are doing Ar save. 



# 3) For your speech emotion detection project, how did you handle audio preprocessing?

Yeah, for a speech. 
Emotion detection. We use radio processing. So what this means. Actually, our, um, this project is mainly mean for healthcare purposes like so how the patient uh emotions, how he is reacting, basically the psychological things, it will be useful and also when there is a call or emergency, so we, the AI immediately get to know. 
OK, what is the status of a um uh. 
And that use it so. 
And so to do all this stuff, like when the user is speaking Arab. 
Uh, calling in the uh phone at our emergency. So we are doing a back to Cheadio into a stream, so from that one we are uh getting in a a fine tuned manner like Kabanhan uh uh. 
One fixed uh uh audio rate and uh uh sorry, audio sample rate and uh uh. 
Uh, audio. 
Uh, channel like a mana channel it is, so we use it on one channel and uh. 
Uh 
And after that one, we use it up, uh, one more tool called uh uh. 


# 4) How do you optimize loops and database interactions in a Ruby application?
