### 1. **How do you handle CSS optimization to improve performance and maintainability?**

To optimize CSS for performance and maintainability, I focus on the following strategies:

1. **Minify and Compress CSS**: I will remove the unnecessary characters (like spaces and comments) to reduce the file size, speeding up load times.
   - **Example**: Tools like `cssnano` or using build tools like Webpack to minify CSS files.
   
3. **Use CSS Preprocessors (e.g., SASS/LESS)**: I usually follow adding with variables, nesting, and mixins, making the CSS easier to manage and extend.
   - **Example**: 
     ```scss
     $primary-color: #333;
     body {
       color: $primary-color;
     }
     ```

4. **CSS Modularization**: I prefer the styles in smaller as reusable components (e.g., BEM or CSS Modules).
                    This avoids code duplication and makes the CSS more maintainable.
   - **Example**: 
     ```scss
     .button {
       padding: 10px 20px;
       background-color: #007bff;
     }
     ```

6. **Remove Unused CSS**: I do use tools like PurifyCSS or Tree-shaking in Webpack to remove unused CSS, reducing the size of the final bundle.
   
7. **Avoid Over-Specific Selectors**: I do use classes over IDs or overly specific selectors to make the CSS more maintainable and easier to override.
   - **Example**: Instead of `#header .nav .item`, use `.nav-item`.

8. **Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for Layouts**: These modern layout techniques help avoid heavy use of floats, which can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain CSS.

9. **Critical CSS**: Inline the critical CSS for above-the-fold content to improve the initial page load speed. Tools like `Critical` can automate this.

### 2. **Can you describe a challenging UI issue you faced and how you resolved it?**

Sure! Here's a simplified version of the answer:

### 2. **Can you describe a challenging UI issue you faced and how you resolved it?**

**Challenge**:
1. **Zero-width space issues in footnote tags**: 
   - I had trouble finding hidden spaces in footnotes that were causing layout problems. To fix it, I had to carefully debug the code and look for these invisible spaces that were messing up the design.

2. **CSS compatibility across different browsers**:
   - Some styles weren't working well in Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. I had to adjust the CSS so that it looked good across different browsers, making sure the layout appeared consistent.

3. **Dropdown list issue while tagging footnotes**:
   - The dropdown list wasn’t working correctly when tagging footnotes and the data missing behind the scene. I investigated the issue, found what was causing it, and made the necessary adjustments to get it functioning properly.

4. **Investigating Terraform component compatibility**:
   - There were some problems with how different Terraform components worked together. I spent time researching the compatibility issues, tested different configurations, and made sure everything worked smoothly.

### 3. **Explain the importance of semantic HTML and its impact on accessibility.**

**Semantic HTML** refers to using HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning in both the structure and content of a page, such as `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`. These tags improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

**Impact on Accessibility**:
1. **Screen Readers**: Semantic tags provide meaningful structure to assistive technologies like screen readers, helping visually impaired users navigate the content.
   - For example, using `<nav>` tags lets screen readers know the part of the page is navigation, and `<main>` marks the main content, making it easier for users to skip to relevant sections.
   
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Semantic elements, when combined with proper ARIA attributes, improve the keyboard navigation experience, allowing users to interact with forms, buttons, and links more easily.

3. **SEO Benefits**: Search engines understand the content structure better when semantic HTML is used, improving the page’s search ranking.
   - For example, using `<article>` instead of a generic `<div>` indicates that the section is a standalone piece of content, which helps search engines categorize the page properly.

**Example**:
```html
<header>
  <h1>Website Title</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>We offer a variety of services...</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2023 Company Name</p>
</footer>
```

In this example, using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` makes the structure clear both for accessibility tools and search engines, improving the overall user experience and visibility.
