### 1. **How do you handle CSS optimization to improve performance and maintainability?**

To optimize CSS for performance and maintainability, I focus on the following strategies:

1. **Minify and Compress CSS**: Minifying CSS removes unnecessary characters (like spaces and comments) to reduce the file size, speeding up load times.
   - **Example**: Tools like `cssnano` or using build tools like Webpack to minify CSS files.
   
2. **Use CSS Preprocessors (e.g., SASS/LESS)**: These allow for better code organization with variables, nesting, and mixins, making the CSS easier to manage and extend.
   - **Example**: 
     ```scss
     $primary-color: #333;
     body {
       color: $primary-color;
     }
     ```

3. **CSS Modularization**: Break down CSS into smaller, reusable components (e.g., BEM or CSS Modules). This avoids code duplication and makes the CSS more maintainable.
   - **Example**: 
     ```scss
     .button {
       padding: 10px 20px;
       background-color: #007bff;
     }
     ```

4. **Remove Unused CSS**: Use tools like PurifyCSS or Tree-shaking in Webpack to remove unused CSS, reducing the size of the final bundle.
   
5. **Avoid Over-Specific Selectors**: Use classes over IDs or overly specific selectors to make the CSS more maintainable and easier to override.
   - **Example**: Instead of `#header .nav .item`, use `.nav-item`.

6. **Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for Layouts**: These modern layout techniques help avoid heavy use of floats, which can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain CSS.

7. **Critical CSS**: Inline the critical CSS for above-the-fold content to improve the initial page load speed. Tools like `Critical` can automate this.

### 2. **Can you describe a challenging UI issue you faced and how you resolved it?**

**Challenge**: I was working on a responsive design where an image gallery didn’t align properly across various screen sizes. On larger screens, the images were stretched, and on smaller screens, they were too small and didn’t fill the space effectively.

**Solution**:
1. **Used Flexbox/Grid Layout**: I replaced the previous fixed-width layouts with Flexbox to make the gallery responsive and fluid.
   - **Example**: 
     ```css
     .gallery {
       display: flex;
       flex-wrap: wrap;
       justify-content: space-around;
     }
     .gallery-item {
       flex: 1 1 100px; /* Ensures items grow and shrink while maintaining a min width */
       margin: 10px;
     }
     ```
2. **Responsive Images**: I used the `srcset` attribute to load different image sizes based on the screen size and resolution.
   - **Example**: 
     ```html
     <img srcset="image-small.jpg 300w, image-medium.jpg 600w, image-large.jpg 1200w" alt="gallery image">
     ```

3. **Media Queries**: I added breakpoints to ensure the layout adjusted properly on different screen sizes.
   - **Example**: 
     ```css
     @media (max-width: 600px) {
       .gallery-item {
         flex-basis: 100%; /* Each image takes up full width on small screens */
       }
     }
     ```

After making these changes, the gallery became responsive, visually appealing, and consistent across devices.

### 3. **Explain the importance of semantic HTML and its impact on accessibility.**

**Semantic HTML** refers to using HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning in both the structure and content of a page, such as `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`. These tags improve accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.

**Impact on Accessibility**:
1. **Screen Readers**: Semantic tags provide meaningful structure to assistive technologies like screen readers, helping visually impaired users navigate the content.
   - For example, using `<nav>` tags lets screen readers know the part of the page is navigation, and `<main>` marks the main content, making it easier for users to skip to relevant sections.
   
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Semantic elements, when combined with proper ARIA attributes, improve the keyboard navigation experience, allowing users to interact with forms, buttons, and links more easily.

3. **SEO Benefits**: Search engines understand the content structure better when semantic HTML is used, improving the page’s search ranking.
   - For example, using `<article>` instead of a generic `<div>` indicates that the section is a standalone piece of content, which helps search engines categorize the page properly.

**Example**:
```html
<header>
  <h1>Website Title</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Our Services</h2>
    <p>We offer a variety of services...</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2023 Company Name</p>
</footer>
```

In this example, using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` makes the structure clear both for accessibility tools and search engines, improving the overall user experience and visibility.
